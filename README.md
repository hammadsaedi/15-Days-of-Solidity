# 15 Days of Solidity
In begining of September 2022, I started 15 Days of Solidity. Before this time, I have significant understandings of Programming Fundamentals in JAVA. It helps a lot to understands sytax and working of Holy Solidity. I tried [Solidity by Example](https://solidity-by-example.org/) each day, and wrote thinkings and understandings in comment. And push it here. LOL.

## Confession
I know, 15 days is very long time for solidity, with basic knowledge of Programming. But I have to do so, because of Busy University Schedule. Still worth it! ;) 

## Lessons Learned
If you stuck it's not your fault; But if you can't google it, then it's your fault.
